Here are the files used by FlameRobin to store configuration information:

fr_databases.conf 
is the list of Firebird servers and databases you work with; 
FlameRobin will create an empty one (with only the “localhost” predefined server) 
when you run it for the first time; 
then you can register new servers and databases.


%userprofile%\AppData\Local\flamerobin
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\flamerobin



fr_settings.conf 
stores FlameRobin's configuration information, like the position 
and size of the main program window. 
You don't need to - and are encouraged not to - edit it by hand.

sys-templates 
(folder) stores code templates used internally by FlameRobin, 
which can be overridden by the user (this is an advanced topic - see below).

code-templates 
(folder) stores code templates that the user can run by means of the Generate code menu 
(this is an advanced topic - see below).

history stores 
(folder) the history of executed SQL statements.
